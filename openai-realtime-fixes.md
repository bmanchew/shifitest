# OpenAI Realtime API Implementation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Model Name Update**: Changed model name from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` across all components.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging in `openaiRealtime.ts` service
   - Improved error message formatting with more context
   - Added Axios error type checking for better error differentiation

3. **Session Creation Robustness**:
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff in `handleCreateSession`
   - Added more verbose logging for debugging session creation issues
   - Ensured proper cleanup in all error cases

4. **Client-Side Improvements**:
   - Updated client React component to specify correct model name
   - Added more verbose logging for debugging WebSocket connections
   - Enhanced user-facing error messages

5. **WebSocket Management**:
   - Fixed issues with audio buffering before session is ready
   - Added proper cleanup in all error and connection close cases
   - Improved tracking of session initialization state

## Key Changes by File

### server/services/openaiRealtime.ts
- Updated default model to `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`
- Enhanced logging format and added more context to logs
- Improved error handling with specific handling for Axios errors
- Added more details to successful response logging

### server/services/openaiRealtimeWebSocket.fixed.ts

- Added proper cleanup in the `finally` block for initialization
- Enhanced error information sent to clients

### client/src/components/customer/RealtimeAudioSherpa.tsx
- Updated model name in WebSocket message payloads
- Added more comprehensive logging for connection state
- Fixed handling of audio data sent before session is fully ready

## Test Scripts

### test-openai-fixed-realtime.js
- Added comprehensive testing of direct OpenAI API connection

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Always use `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` as the model name for OpenAI Realtime API.
2. Make sure to check for the `transcription_session.created` event before sending audio data.
3. Properly handle audio buffering when audio data arrives before session is ready.
4. Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms when connecting to external services.
5. Use detailed, structured logging to facilitate debugging of WebSocket-related issues.

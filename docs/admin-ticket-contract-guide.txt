# ShiFi Tester: Admin Guide to Contract-Integrated Support Tickets

## Overview

This guide explains how to effectively manage support tickets with the new contract integration feature as an administrator. The contract integration allows you to see whether a ticket is associated with a specific contract or is a general, non-contract related issue.

## Viewing Tickets

### Dashboard View

In the admin dashboard, support tickets are now clearly labeled with their contract status:

- **Contract-Associated Tickets**: Display the contract number and a link to view the contract details
- **General Tickets**: Marked as "Not Contract Related" 

The support ticket list can be filtered to show:
- All tickets
- Only contract-related tickets 
- Only general (non-contract) tickets

### Individual Ticket View

When viewing an individual ticket, contract information (if applicable) is displayed in the ticket header. This includes:

1. Contract number
2. Contract status 
3. Customer name
4. Quick link to view the complete contract details

For tickets marked as "Not Contract Related," you'll see a clear indicator in place of contract details.

## Analytics and Reporting

The Analytics Dashboard has been enhanced to show:

1. Distribution of tickets between contract-related and general issues
2. Most common contracts generating support tickets
3. Trends in ticket types by contract status
4. Resolution times comparing contract vs. non-contract tickets

## Assignment and Workflow

### Automatic Assignment

The automated assignment system now considers contract expertise when assigning tickets:

- Agents with knowledge of specific contracts get priority for contract-related tickets
- General tickets are assigned based on topic expertise and workload balancing

### Manual Assignment

When manually assigning tickets, you can view agent expertise in relation to contracts. The agent selection interface highlights:

- Agents who have previously worked with the specific contract
- Agents with expertise in the contract's financial product type
- Current workload distribution

## Best Practices

1. **Use Contract Context**: When responding to contract-related tickets, always review the contract details first
2. **Appropriate Categorization**: Ensure tickets are properly categorized as contract-related or general
3. **Cross-Reference Issues**: Look for patterns of issues across similar contracts
4. **Update Knowledge Base**: Create separate knowledge base articles for contract-specific and general issues
5. **Training Focus**: Train support agents on both contract-specific troubleshooting and general merchant support

## Technical Notes

- Contract integration is fully reflected in the ticket notification system
- SMS alerts include contract details when relevant
- The ticket-to-contract association is stored in the database and cannot be changed after ticket creation
- All ticket exports and reports include the contract association status

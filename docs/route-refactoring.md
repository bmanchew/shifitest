# Route Refactoring Documentation

## Problem Statement

The ShiFi platform experienced a 404 error issue with the login page, which appeared to be a routing configuration issue. Users were unable to authenticate through the web interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

Our investigation revealed several issues:

1. **Monolithic Route File**: The application used a single, large `routes.ts` file that was difficult to maintain and prone to errors.

2. **Path Inconsistency**: Client-side code expected auth endpoints at `/api/auth/login`, but the server was registering them differently.

3. **Router Mounting Issues**: Express routers were not properly mounted to handle the exact paths expected by clients.

4. **CSRF Token Handling**: The error appeared as a 404, but some cases were actually 403 responses due to missing CSRF tokens.

## Implemented Solution

We implemented a comprehensive routing system refactoring:

1. **Modular Router Structure**: 
   - Created separate router files for each domain area (auth, users, merchants, etc.)
   - Each router handles its own middleware and route definitions

2. **Main Router Aggregation**:
   - Implemented a main router that properly mounts all feature-specific routers
   - Ensured consistent path prefixes across the application

3. **Consistent Path Resolution**:
   - Fixed path prefixes to match client expectations
   - Ensured that router mounting preserves the full path structure

4. **Enhanced Request Logging**:
   - Added detailed request/response logging
   - Implemented CSRF validation logging
   - Added path resolution debugging

5. **Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Created specialized testing tools with CSRF token handling
   - Implemented safe deployment process with backup/restore capabilities

## Implementation Process

The refactoring was implemented through a careful, reversible process:

1. **Diagnosis**: Created test scripts to identify the exact nature of routing issues.

2. **Development**: Created optimized, modularized router files alongside the existing system.

3. **Testing**: Verified the new routes with specialized diagnostic tools.

4. **Deployment**: Used a dedicated script to safely apply changes and restart the server.

5. **Verification**: Confirmed functionality with additional tests.

## Technical Details

### Path Structure

The refactored routing system follows this structure:

```
/api/auth/login        - User login endpoint
/api/auth/logout       - User logout endpoint
/api/auth/refresh      - Token refresh endpoint
/api/csrf-token        - CSRF token generation endpoint
```

### Router Mounting

Router mounting is now handled with proper path prefixes:

```typescript
// Main router
const mainRouter = express.Router();

// Feature routers
const authRouter = express.Router();
const userRouter = express.Router();

// Mount feature routers on main router
mainRouter.use('/auth', authRouter);
mainRouter.use('/users', userRouter);

// Mount main router on app
app.use('/api', mainRouter);
```

### CSRF Protection

CSRF protection is correctly applied to auth routes:

```typescript
// Apply CSRF protection to auth routes
authRouter.post('/login', csrfProtection, authController.login);
authRouter.post('/logout', csrfProtection, authController.logout);
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Router Modularity**: Breaking down routes by domain area significantly improves maintainability.

2. **Path Resolution**: Pay careful attention to how Express handles path concatenation when mounting routers.

3. **Testing Strategy**: Specialized test scripts with token handling are essential for diagnosing auth issues.

4. **Safe Deployment**: Always implement a backup/restore mechanism when refactoring critical paths.

5. **Logging Enhancement**: Detailed request logging is invaluable for troubleshooting routing issues.

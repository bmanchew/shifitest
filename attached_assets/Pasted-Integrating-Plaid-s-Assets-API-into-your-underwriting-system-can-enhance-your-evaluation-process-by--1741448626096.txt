## 2. Data Capture for Underwriting Criteria

Aligning with your 30-point underwriting system, Plaid's Assets API can capture the following data:

### a. Annual Income Verification

**Objective:** Accurately verify the applicant's annual income.

**Method:**

- **Income Analysis:** Identify and aggregate income-related transactions (e.g., direct deposits) over a specified period to calculate annual income.

**Implementation:**

- Use transaction data from the Asset Report to identify regular income deposits.
- Calculate the total income over the analysis period and extrapolate to annual income if necessary.

### b. Employment History Verification

**Objective:** Verify the applicant's employment status and history.

**Method:**

- **Direct Deposit Analysis:** Identify consistent direct deposits from employers to determine employment duration and stability.

**Implementation:**

- Analyze transaction descriptions to identify employer names and deposit frequencies.
- Determine the length of employment based on the duration of consistent deposits.

### c. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Calculation

**Objective:** Calculate the applicant's DTI ratio to assess financial obligations relative to income.

**Method:**

- **Debt Identification:** Identify recurring debt payments (e.g., loans, credit cards) from transaction data.
- **Income Verification:** Use verified income data as described above.

**Implementation:**

- Sum all identified debt payments to determine total monthly debt.
- Calculate the DTI ratio by dividing total monthly debt by gross monthly income.

### d. Housing Payment Analysis

**Objective:** Assess the applicant's housing payment consistency and amount.

**Method:**

- **Transaction Filtering:** Identify transactions related to housing payments (e.g., rent, mortgage) occurring within regular intervals.

**Implementation:**

- Filter transactions using keywords associated with housing payments.
- Verify the regularity and timeliness of these payments to assess reliability.

### e. Delinquency and Adverse History Assessment

**Objective:** Evaluate the applicant's financial responsibility by identifying any delinquent or adverse financial events.

**Method:**

- **Transaction Analysis:** Detect instances of overdrafts, insufficient funds, or late payment fees.

**Implementation:**

- Analyze transaction histories for fees or penalties indicative of financial mismanagement.
- Assess the frequency and recency of such events to determine their impact on the applicant's financial profile.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### a. Create an Asset Report

Initiate the creation of an Asset Report to gather the applicant's financial data.

**Request Example:**

```json
POST /asset_report/create
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "secret": "YOUR_SECRET",
  "access_tokens": ["user_access_token"],
  "days_requested": 30,
  "options": {
    "client_report_id": "unique_report_id",
    "webhook": "https://yourapp.com/plaid-webhook",
    "user": {

      "phone_number": "+14151234567",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "asset_report_token": "generated_asset_report_token",
  "asset_report_id": "unique_asset_report_id"
}
```


*Note: Asset Reports are generated asynchronously. Plaid will send a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook upon completion.*

### b. Retrieve and Parse the Asset Report

Once the Asset Report is ready, retrieve it in JSON format for programmatic analysis.

**Request Example:**

```json
POST /asset_report/get
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "secret": "YOUR_SECRET",
  "asset_report_token": "generated_asset_report_token"
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "report": {
    "items": [
      {
        "accounts": [
          {
            "account_id": "account_id",

Absolutely! Here's a detailed prompt you can send to an AI developer to help them **stabilize**, **modularize**, and **clean up** your backend codebase â€” especially if your current code has become cluttered, such as with an oversized `routes.ts` file.

### ðŸ§  Prompt for AI Developer: Stabilize & Modularize Backend Code

Hey [AI Assistant/Developer Name],

I'm working on a Node.js backend project (Express + TypeScript), and I need your help to make the codebase more **stable**, **maintainable**, and **modular**.

Right now, some files â€” especially `routes.ts` â€” have gotten way too large and hard to manage. I want to break everything into smaller, **task-specific files**, follow best practices for clean architecture, and ensure the project is easy to scale and debug.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Refactor the codebase into smaller, more focused modules
- Improve file structure and separation of concerns
- Clean up any repeated patterns or logic
- Add appropriate type safety and comments where needed
- Make the API routes easier to read and maintain
- Avoid "mega-files" like one giant routes file
- Ensure the app remains fully functional and stable

### âœ… Key Requirements

1. **Split routes into feature-specific route files**
   - For example:
     ```
     routes/
       â”œâ”€â”€ auth.routes.ts
       â”œâ”€â”€ contract.routes.ts
       â”œâ”€â”€ user.routes.ts
       â””â”€â”€ index.ts  <-- combine them here
     ```
   - Each route file should handle just one domain (auth, contracts, etc.)

2. **Move business logic to controller files**
   - Avoid placing logic directly in the routes
   - Structure like:
     ```
     controllers/
       â”œâ”€â”€ auth.controller.ts
       â”œâ”€â”€ contract.controller.ts
     ```

3. **Separate validation and middleware**
   - Use dedicated files for request validation (e.g. Zod or Joi schemas)
   - Structure like:
     ```
     validators/
       â”œâ”€â”€ auth.validator.ts
       â”œâ”€â”€ contract.validator.ts
     ```

4. **Refactor shared utilities and services**
   - Extract any reusable code (e.g., JWT handling, database helpers) into `utils/` or `services/` directory

5. **Improve file structure (Suggested layout):**
   ```
   src/
     â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
     â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
     â”œâ”€â”€ services/
     â”œâ”€â”€ validators/
     â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/
     â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
     â”œâ”€â”€ models/ (if using)
     â””â”€â”€ index.ts (or main entry)
   ```

6. **Clean up the main `index.ts` or `server.ts`**
   - Move route setup to a `routes/index.ts`
   - Import and mount all routes via `app.use(...)`
   - Example:
     ```ts
     import routes from './routes';
     app.use('/api', routes);
     ```

7. **Add comments and typings where missing**
   - Ensure every function, route handler, and controller method has appropriate TypeScript types
   - Add short JSDoc comments for non-obvious logic

8. **Fix any broken logic / bugs in the process**
   - If you notice any non-functional or unstable patterns, fix them or flag them
   - Prefer async/await over `.then()` chains for readability

9. **Ensure consistent formatting**
   - Run Prettier and ESLint across all files
   - Adopt a clean code style (camelCase, PascalCase where needed, descriptive function names)

---

### ðŸš€ Deliverables
- Fully refactored backend codebase
- Routes separated by domain
- Controllers and services modularized
- Improved folder structure
- Stable, running app with the same (or better) functionality
- Optional: a short README or doc summary of what was changed and where to find things

Let me know if you'd like me to pass along an example of a route/controller pair to base this on. Thanks!

# Assets

#### API reference for Assets endpoints and webhooks

Create, delete, retrieve and share Asset Reports with information about a user's assets and transactions. For how-to guidance on Asset Reports, see the [Assets documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/assets/).

All the endpoints on this page are also compatible with [Financial Insights Reports (UK/EU only)](https://plaid.com/docs/assets/#financial-insights-reports-ukeu-only) and will automatically operate on Financial Insights Reports instead of Asset Reports if the Financial Insights Report add-on has been enabled.

[**Endpoints**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#endpoints) [**`/asset_report/create`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate)

[**Create an Asset Report**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#create-an-asset-report)

The [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) or [`/asset_report/pdf/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget) endpoints.

The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate). The exact amount of time to create the report will vary depending on how many days of history are requested and will typically range from a few seconds to about one minute. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) or [`/asset_report/pdf/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget), Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

The [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the [`/asset_report/refresh`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportrefresh) endpoint.

asset\_report/create

**Request fields** Collapse all

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

An array of access tokens corresponding to the Items that will be included in the report. The `assets` product must have been initialized for the Items during link; the Assets product cannot be added after initialization.

Min items: `1`

Max items: `99`

The maximum integer number of days of history to include in the Asset Report. If using Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty, `days_requested` must be at least 61 for new originations or at least 31 for refinancings.

An Asset Report requested with "Additional History" (that is, with more than 61 days of transaction history) will incur an Additional History fee.

Maximum: `731`

Minimum: `0`

An optional object to filter `/asset_report/create` results. If provided, must be non- `null`. The optional `user` object is required for the report to be eligible for Fannie Mae's Day 1 Certainty program.

Hide object

Client-generated identifier, which can be used by lenders to track loan applications.

URL to which Plaid will send Assets webhooks, for example when the requested Asset Report is ready.

A list of add-ons that should be included in the Asset Report.

`fast_assets`: When Fast Assets is requested, Plaid will create two versions of the Asset Report: the Fast Asset Report, which will contain only Identity and Balance information, and the Full Asset Report, which will also contain Transactions information. A `PRODUCT_READY` webhook will be fired for each Asset Report when it is ready, and the `report_type` field will indicate whether the webhook is firing for the `full` or `fast` Asset Report. To retrieve the Fast Asset Report, call `/asset_report/get` with `fast_report` set to `true`. There is no additional charge for using Fast Assets. To create a Fast Asset Report, Plaid must successfully retrieve both Identity and Balance data; if Plaid encounters an error obtaining this data, the Fast Asset Report will not be created. However, as long as Plaid can obtain Transactions data, the Full Asset Report will still be available.

`investments`: Request an Asset Report with Investments. To properly fetch investments data, `investments` must be specified in the `optional_products` array when initializing Link.

Possible values: `investments`, `fast_assets`

The user object allows you to provide additional information about the user to be appended to the Asset Report. All fields are optional. The `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ssn` fields are required if you would like the Report to be eligible for Fannie Mae’s Day 1 Certainty™ program.

The user's email address.

If set to false, only 1 item must be healthy at the time of report creation. The default value is true, which would require all items to be healthy at the time of report creation.

Default: `true`

[**`/asset_report/get`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget)

[**Retrieve an Asset Report**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#retrieve-an-asset-report)

The [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget), you must first create the Asset Report using [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) (or filter an Asset Report using [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter)) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) with `options.add_ons` set to `["fast_assets"]`. This will cause Plaid to create two versions of the Asset Report: one with only current and available balance and identity information, and then later on the complete Asset Report. You will receive separate webhooks for each version of the Asset Report.

asset\_report/get

**Request fields** Collapse all

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

A token that can be provided to endpoints such as `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` to fetch or update an Asset Report.

`true` if you would like to retrieve the Asset Report with Insights, `false` otherwise. This field defaults to `false` if omitted.

Default: `false`

`true` to fetch "fast" version of asset report. Defaults to false if omitted. Can only be used if `/asset_report/create` was called with `options.add_ons` set to `["fast_assets"]`.

Default: `false`

asset\_report/get

**Response fields** and example

Collapse all

An object representing an Asset Report

Hide object

A unique ID identifying an Asset Report. Like all Plaid identifiers, this ID is case sensitive.

An identifier you determine and submit for the Asset Report.

The date and time when the Asset Report was created, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (e.g. "2018-04-12T03:32:11Z").

Format: `date-time`

The duration of transaction history you requested

The user object allows you to provide additional information about the user to be appended to the Asset Report. All fields are optional. The `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ssn` fields are required if you would like the Report to be eligible for Fannie Mae’s Day 1 Certainty™ program.

Hide object

An identifier you determine and submit for the user. If using the Credit Dashboard, Customers should pass in the `user_token` created in `/user/create`.

The user's first name. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

The user's middle name

The user's last name. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

The user's Social Security Number. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

Format: "ddd-dd-dddd"

The user's phone number, in E.164 format: +{countrycode}{number}. For example: "+14151234567". Phone numbers provided in other formats will be parsed on a best-effort basis.

The user's email address.

Data returned by Plaid about each of the Items included in the Asset Report.

Hide object

The `item_id` of the Item associated with this webhook, warning, or error

The full financial institution name associated with the Item.

The id of the financial institution associated with the Item.

The date and time when this Item’s data was last retrieved from the financial institution, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

Format: `date-time`

Data about each of the accounts open on the Item.

Hide object

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.

The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.

If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.

Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

Hide object

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.

Format: `double`

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae ( `ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

Format: `double`

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.

For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.

In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.

Format: `double`

The total amount of borrowed funds in the account, as determined by the financial institution.
For investment-type accounts, the margin balance is the total value of borrowed assets in the account, as presented by the institution.
This is commonly referred to as margin or a loan.

Format: `double`

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.

See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code` s.

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.

This field is only used and expected when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One) and the Item contains one or more accounts with a non-depository account type, in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For Capital One depository accounts as well as all other account types on all other institutions, this field is ignored. See [account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type-schema) for a full list of account types.

If the balance that is pulled is older than the given timestamp for Items with this field required, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.

Format: `date-time`

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of an account's official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item's accounts, and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user.

The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself

[**Retrieve a PDF Asset Report**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#retrieve-a-pdf-asset-report)

The [`/asset_report/pdf/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget) endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling [`/asset_report/pdf/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget), you must first create the Asset Report using [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) (or filter an Asset Report using [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter)) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

The response to [`/asset_report/pdf/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget) is the PDF binary data. The `request_id` is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

[**Refresh an Asset Report**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#refresh-an-asset-report)

An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the [`/asset_report/refresh`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportrefresh) endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter). By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to [`/asset_report/refresh`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportrefresh). Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

[**`/asset_report/filter`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter)

[**Filter Asset Report**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#filter-asset-report)

By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the [`/accounts/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget) endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter) endpoint.

To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate) endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter) endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter) does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter) creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via [`/asset_report/filter`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportfilter) do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

[**Create Asset Report Audit Copy**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#create-asset-report-audit-copy)

Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the [`/asset_report/audit_copy/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportaudit_copycreate) endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

The [`/asset_report/audit_copy/remove`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportaudit_copyremove) endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.

asset\_report/audit\_copy/remove

**Request fields**

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

The `audit_copy_token` granting access to the Audit Copy you would like to revoke.

[**Create a relay token to share an Asset Report with a partner client**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#create-a-relay-token-to-share-an-asset-report-with-a-partner-client)

Plaid can share an Asset Report directly with a participating third party on your behalf. The shared Asset Report is the exact same Asset Report originally created in [`/asset_report/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportcreate).

To grant a third party access to an Asset Report, use the [`/credit/relay/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#creditrelaycreate) endpoint to create a `relay_token` and then pass that token to your third party. Each third party has its own `secondary_client_id`; for example, `ce5bd328dcd34123456`. You'll need to create a separate `relay_token` for each third party that needs access to the report on your behalf.

credit/relay/create

**Request fields**

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

List of report token strings, with at most one token of each report type. Currently only Asset Report token is supported.

The `secondary_client_id` is the client id of the third party with whom you would like to share the relay token.

URL to which Plaid will send webhooks when the Secondary Client successfully retrieves an Asset Report by calling `/credit/relay/get`.

An object representing an Asset Report

Hide object

A unique ID identifying an Asset Report. Like all Plaid identifiers, this ID is case sensitive.

An identifier you determine and submit for the Asset Report.

The date and time when the Asset Report was created, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (e.g. "2018-04-12T03:32:11Z").

Format: `date-time`

The duration of transaction history you requested

The user object allows you to provide additional information about the user to be appended to the Asset Report. All fields are optional. The `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ssn` fields are required if you would like the Report to be eligible for Fannie Mae’s Day 1 Certainty™ program.

Hide object

An identifier you determine and submit for the user. If using the Credit Dashboard, Customers should pass in the `user_token` created in `/user/create`.

The user's first name. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

The user's middle name

The user's last name. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

The user's Social Security Number. Required for the Fannie Mae Day 1 Certainty™ program.

Format: "ddd-dd-dddd"

The user's phone number, in E.164 format: +{countrycode}{number}. For example: "+14151234567". Phone numbers provided in other formats will be parsed on a best-effort basis.

The user's email address.

Data returned by Plaid about each of the Items included in the Asset Report.

Hide object

The `item_id` of the Item associated with this webhook, warning, or error

The full financial institution name associated with the Item.

The id of the financial institution associated with the Item.

The date and time when this Item’s data was last retrieved from the financial institution, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

Format: `date-time`

Data about each of the accounts open on the Item.

Hide object

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.

The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.

If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.

Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

Hide object

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.

Format: `double`

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae ( `ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

Format: `double`

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.

For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.

In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.

Format: `double`

The total amount of borrowed funds in the account, as determined by the financial institution.
For investment-type accounts, the margin balance is the total value of borrowed assets in the account, as presented by the institution.
This is commonly referred to as margin or a loan.

Format: `double`

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.

See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code` s.

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.

This field is only used and expected when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One) and the Item contains one or more accounts with a non-depository account type, in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For Capital One depository accounts as well as all other account types on all other institutions, this field is ignored. See [account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type-schema) for a full list of account types.

If the balance that is pulled is older than the given timestamp for Items with this field required, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.

Format: `date-time`

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of an account's official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item's accounts, and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user.

The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself

[**Refresh a report of a relay token**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#refresh-a-report-of-a-relay-token)

The [`/credit/relay/refresh`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#creditrelayrefresh) endpoint allows third parties to refresh a report that was relayed to them, using a `relay_token` that was created by the report owner. A new report will be created with the original report parameters, but with the most recent data available based on the `days_requested` value of the original report.

credit/relay/refresh

**Request fields**

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

The `relay_token` granting access to the report you would like to refresh.

The report type. It can be `asset`. Income report types are not yet supported.

Possible values: `asset`

The URL registered to receive webhooks when the report of a relay token has been refreshed.

[**`/credit/relay/remove`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#creditrelayremove)

[**Remove relay token**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#remove-relay-token)

The [`/credit/relay/remove`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#creditrelayremove) endpoint allows you to invalidate a `relay_token`. The third party holding the token will no longer be able to access or refresh the reports which the `relay_token` gives access to. The original report, associated Items, and other relay tokens that provide access to the same report are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given `relay_token`.

[**Webhooks**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks) [**`PRODUCT_READY`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready)

Fired when the Asset Report has been generated and [`/asset_report/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) is ready to be called. If you attempt to retrieve an Asset Report before this webhook has fired, you’ll receive a response with the HTTP status code 400 and a Plaid error code of `PRODUCT_NOT_READY`.

`ASSETS`

`PRODUCT_READY`

The `asset_report_id` corresponding to the Asset Report the webhook has fired for.

The `user_id` corresponding to the User ID the webhook has fired for.

Indicates either a Fast Asset Report, which will contain only current identity and balance information, or a Full Asset Report, which will also contain historical balance information and transaction data.

Possible values: `FULL`, `FAST`

The Plaid environment the webhook was sent from

Possible values: `sandbox`, `production`

[**`ERROR`**](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#error)

Fired when Asset Report generation has failed. The resulting `error` will have an `error_type` of `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`.

Collapse all

`ASSETS`

`ERROR`

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non- `null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

Hide object

A broad categorization of the error. Safe for programmatic use.

Possible values: `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_RESULT`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `INSTITUTION_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `API_ERROR`, `ITEM_ERROR`, `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`, `RECAPTCHA_ERROR`, `OAUTH_ERROR`, `PAYMENT_ERROR`, `BANK_TRANSFER_ERROR`, `INCOME_VERIFICATION_ERROR`, `MICRODEPOSITS_ERROR`, `SANDBOX_ERROR`, `PARTNER_ERROR`, `TRANSACTIONS_ERROR`, `TRANSACTION_ERROR`, `TRANSFER_ERROR`, `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`, `CONSUMER_REPORT_ERROR`

The particular error code. Safe for programmatic use.

The specific reason for the error code. Currently, reasons are only supported OAuth-based item errors; `null` will be returned otherwise. Safe for programmatic use.

Possible values:
`OAUTH_INVALID_TOKEN`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution has been invalidated.

`OAUTH_CONSENT_EXPIRED`: The user's access consent for this OAuth connection to this institution has expired.

`OAUTH_USER_REVOKED`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution is invalid because the user revoked their connection.

A developer-friendly representation of the error code. This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

A user-friendly representation of the error code. `null` if the error is not related to user action.

This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

A unique ID identifying the request, to be used for troubleshooting purposes. This field will be omitted in errors provided by webhooks.

In this product, a request can pertain to more than one Item. If an error is returned for such a request, `causes` will return an array of errors containing a breakdown of these errors on the individual Item level, if any can be identified.

`causes` will be provided for the `error_type` `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR` or `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`. `causes` will also not be populated inside an error nested within a `warning` object.

The HTTP status code associated with the error. This will only be returned in the response body when the error information is provided via a webhook.

The URL of a Plaid documentation page with more information about the error

Suggested steps for resolving the error

The ID associated with the Asset Report.

The `user_id` corresponding to the User ID the webhook has fired for.

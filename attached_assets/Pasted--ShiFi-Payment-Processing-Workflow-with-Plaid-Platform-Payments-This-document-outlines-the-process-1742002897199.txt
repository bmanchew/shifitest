# ShiFi Payment Processing Workflow with Plaid Platform Payments

This document outlines the process for handling payments from merchant customers within the ShiFi platform, detailing the routing of funds based on whether a contract is purchased by the ShiFi Fund. It leverages Plaid's Platform Payments feature to facilitate seamless transactions.

## Overview

When a merchant initiates a payment, the destination of the funds depends on the status of the associated contract:

- **Contract Purchased by ShiFi Fund**: Funds are routed directly to the ShiFi Fund's account.
- **Contract Not Purchased by ShiFi Fund**: Funds are deposited into the merchant's account.

Plaid's Platform Payments enables ShiFi to manage these transactions efficiently by onboarding merchants (end-customers) and facilitating fund transfers on their behalf.

## Integration with Plaid Platform Payments

Plaid's Platform Payments allows platforms like ShiFi to onboard end-customers and manage payments between them and their users. The integration involves the following steps:

1. **Onboarding End-Customers**: Merchants are onboarded to the ShiFi platform using Plaid's Know Your Business (KYB) solution.
2. **Linking Bank Accounts**: Merchants link their bank accounts to the ShiFi platform using Plaid Link, ensuring secure and verified connections.
3. **Authorizing and Creating Transfers**: ShiFi initiates transfers on behalf of merchants, directing funds based on contract status.

### 1. Onboarding End-Customers

ShiFi must onboard merchants as end-customers using Plaid's KYB solution, which includes an out-of-the-box onboarding UI.

**Process**:

- **Create an End-Customer**: Call `/partner/customer/create` with `auth` specified, followed by `/partner/customer/enable`.
- **Obtain Onboarding URL**: Call `/transfer/questionnaire/create` to generate a unique onboarding URL for the merchant.
- **Merchant Completes Onboarding**: The merchant uses the onboarding URL to provide business details and agree to Plaid's terms.
- **Check Onboarding Status**: Use `/transfer/originator/get` to monitor the merchant's onboarding status.

### 2. Linking Bank Accounts

Once onboarded, merchants link their bank accounts through Plaid Link.

**Process**:

- **Initialize Link**: ShiFi generates a `link_token` by calling `/link/token/create` with the `transfer` product specified.
- **Launch Link**: The merchant completes the Link flow, selecting and authenticating their bank account.
- **Exchange Tokens**: Upon successful linking, ShiFi exchanges the `public_token` for an `access_token` using `/item/public_token/exchange`.

### 3. Authorizing and Creating Transfers

ShiFi initiates transfers on behalf of merchants, specifying the `originator_client_id` to indicate the merchant for whom the transfer is being made.

**Process**:

- **Create Authorization**: Call `/transfer/authorization/create` with details such as `access_token`, `account_id`, `type` (credit or debit), `network` (ACH, RTP, FedNow), `amount`, and `originator_client_id`.
- **Execute Transfer**: Call `/transfer/create` with the `authorization_id` obtained from the previous step.

## Routing Logic Based on Contract Status

The destination of the funds is determined by the contract's purchase status:

- **Contract Purchased by ShiFi Fund**:
  - **Destination Account**: ShiFi Fund's bank account.
  - **Process**: Funds are transferred from the merchant's account to the ShiFi Fund's account.

- **Contract Not Purchased by ShiFi Fund**:
  - **Destination Account**: Merchant's bank account.
  - **Process**: Funds are transferred from the payer's account to the merchant's account.

**Implementation**:

- **Determine Contract Status**: Before initiating a transfer, check the contract's purchase status.
- **Set Destination Account**: Based on the status, set the appropriate destination account details in the transfer authorization and creation requests.

## Facilitator Fees

ShiFi can collect fees per transfer by specifying the `facilitator_fee` parameter in `/transfer/create`. This fee is allocated to ShiFi's platform ledger balance.

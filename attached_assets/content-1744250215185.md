# DataCrunch API Documentation

## Authentication

DataCrunch uses API keys for authentication. Each request requires an API key to be included in the request headers. Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

### Authentication with API Keys

All API requests must include your API key in one of the following ways:

1. As a header: `X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here`
2. As a bearer token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`

Example request:

```bash
curl https://api.datacrunch.io/v1/tts \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello world", 
    "voice_id": "speaker_0", 
    "model_id": "tts1"
  }'
```

### Response Formats

Responses are returned in JSON format. A successful response will have a status code of 200 and contain the generated audio data encoded in base64 format.

# Invalid Input Errors

#### Guide to troubleshooting invalid input errors

[****DIRECT\_INTEGRATION\_NOT\_ENABLED****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#direct_integration_not_enabled)

##### An attempt was made to create an Item without using Link.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes)

- `/item/create` was called directly, without using Link.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps)

In the Production environment, use Link to create the Item. In Sandbox, use [`/sandbox/public_token/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxpublic_tokencreate)

[****INCORRECT\_DEPOSIT\_VERIFICATION****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#incorrect_deposit_verification)

##### The user submitted an incorrect Manual Same-Day micro-deposit verification input during Item verification in Link.

##### Sample user-facing error message

Code is incorrect, 2 attempts remaining: Check the bank statement of your account ending in •••0000 for the $0.01 deposit and try again.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-1)

- Your user submitted an incorrect micro-deposit verification input when verifying an account via Manual Same-Day micro-deposits.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-1)

Have your user attempt to enter the micro-deposit verification input again.

If your user enters an incorrect micro-deposit verification input three times, the Item will be permanently locked. In this case, you must restart the Link flow from the beginning and have the user re-link their account.

[****INVALID\_ACCESS\_TOKEN****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_access_token)

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-2)

- Access tokens are in the format: `access-<environment>-<identifier>`
- This error can happen when the `access_token` you provided is invalid or pertains to a different API environment

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-2)

Make sure you are not using a token created in one environment in a different environment (for example, using a Sandbox token in the Production environment).

Ensure that the `client_id`, `secret`, and `access_token` are all associated with the same Plaid developer account.

[****INVALID\_ACCOUNT\_ID****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_account_id)

##### The supplied `account_id` is not valid

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-3)

One of the `account_id`(s) specified in the API call's `account_ids` object is invalid or does not exist.

- Your integration is passing a correctly formatted, but invalid `account_id` for the Item in question.
- The underlying account may have been closed at the bank, and thus removed from our API.
- The Item affected is at an institution that uses OAuth-based connections, and the user revoked access to the specific account.
- The `account_id` was erroneously removed from our API, either completely or a new `account_id` was assigned to the same
underlying account.
- You are requesting an account that your user has de-selected in the Account Select v2 update flow.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-3)

Verify that your integration is passing in correctly formatted and valid `account_id`(s)

Ensure that your integration only uses `account_id`(s) that belong to the Item in question. Early on in your development it is
important to verify that your integration only uses `account_id`(s), and other Plaid identifiers like `item_id`, for the Item that they belong to.

Also be sure to preserve the case of any non-numeric characters in Plaid identifiers, as they are case sensitive.

Verify the Item's currently active accounts and their `account_id`(s).

The user may have revoked access to the account. If this is the case, it is a security best practice to give the user a choice between restoring their account and having your app delete all data for that account. If your user wants to restore access to the account, you can put them through [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/), which will give them the option to grant access to the account again. Note that doing so will result in an account with a new and different `account_id`, which can be obtained by calling [`/accounts/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget).

Verify that after completing update mode, your implementation checks for the current `account_id` information associated with the Item, instead of re-using the pre-update mode `account_id`(s). Updated `account_id` data can be found in the `onSuccess` Link event, or by calling certain endpoints, such as [`/accounts/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget).

Verify that the `account_id` was not changed or removed from the API.

[**Account churn**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#account-churn)

If the underlying account has not been closed or changed at the bank and the `account_id` no longer appears, Plaid may have
removed the account entirely or assigned the account a new `account_id`, a situation known as "account churn".

Some common causes for account churn are:

- The Item was in an unhealthy state for an extended period of time. If an Item has remained in an error state for over a year, its underlying data may be removed. If the Item is then later refreshed, the Item data will be re-generated, resulting in new `account_id` data.
- The bank or user drastically changing the name of the account, e.g. an account named "Savings account" becomes "Jane's vacation fund".
- The account's mask is changed by the bank, which can occur when banks change their backend systems.

Account churn caused by the latter two reasons is unexpected API behavior. If you experience account churn on an Item that was otherwise healthy, [file a Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/financial-institutions/missing-data/missing-accounts).

##### The client ID and secret included in the request body were invalid. Find your API keys in the Dashboard.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-4)

- The API keys are not valid for the environment being used, which can commonly happen when switching between development environments and forgetting to switch API keys

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-4)

Find your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/keys).

Make sure you are using the secret that corresponds to the environment you are using (Sandbox or Production).

Make sure you are not using a token created in one environment in a different environment (for example, using a Sandbox token in the Production environment).

Visit the Plaid [Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/) to verify that you are enabled for the environment you are using.

##### The audit copy token supplied to the server was invalid.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-5)

- You attempted to access an Asset Report using an `audit_copy_token` that is invalid or was revoked using [`/asset_report/audit_copy/remove`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportaudit_copyremove) or [`/asset_report/remove`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportremove).

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-5)

[****INVALID\_LINK\_CUSTOMIZATION****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_link_customization)

##### The Link customization is not valid for the request.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-7)

- The Link customization is missing a use case and the session is enabled for Data Transparency Messaging.
- This error can happen when requesting to update account selections with a Link customization that does not enable [Account Select v2](https://plaid.com/docs/link/customization/#account-select).

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-7)

In the Dashboard, under [Link > Link Customization > Data Transparency Messaging](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link/data-transparency-v5), ensure at least one use case is selected.

Update your Link customization to enable Account Select v2 or use a Link customization with Account Select v2 enabled.

[****INVALID\_LINK\_TOKEN****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_link_token)

##### The `link_token` provided to initialize Link was invalid.

##### Sample user-facing error message

Username or password incorrect: Check that your credentials are the same that you use for this institution

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-8)

- The `link_token` has expired. A `link_token` lasts at least 30 minutes before expiring.
- The `link_token` was already used. A `link_token` can only be used once, except when working in the Sandbox test environment.
- The `link_token` was created in a different environment than the one it was used with. For example, a Sandbox `link_token` was used in Production.
- A user entered invalid credentials too many times during the Link flow, invalidating the `link_token`.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-8)

Confirm that the `link_token` is from the correct environment.

Generate a new `link_token` for initializing Link with and re-launch Link.

[****INVALID\_PROCESSOR\_TOKEN****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_processor_token)

##### The `processor_token` provided to initialize Link was invalid.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-9)

- The `processor_token` used to initialize Link was invalid.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-9)

If you are testing in Sandbox, make sure that your `processor_token` was created using the Sandbox-specific endpoint [`/sandbox/processor_token/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxprocessor_tokencreate) instead of `/processor_token/create`. Likewise, if testing in Production, make sure that your `processor_token` was created using `/processor_token/create` rather than [`/sandbox/processor_token/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxprocessor_tokencreate).

Make sure you are not using a `processor_token` created in one environment in a different environment (for example, using a Sandbox token in the Production environment).

[****INVALID\_PRODUCT****](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_product)

##### Your client ID does not have access to this product.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-10)

- The endpoint you are trying to access is not enabled for your account in the environment where you are trying to use it. For example, Identity Verification access is only available in Sandbox after you have received Production access.
- Your integration is using a partner endpoint integration that has not yet been enabled in the Dashboard.
- Your integration is attempting to call a processor endpoint on an Item that was initialized with products that are not compatible with processor endpoints.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-10)

If you do not already have access to this product in Production, submit a [product request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/request-products).

If you are using a partner integration, check the Dashboard [Integrations page](https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/integrations) to make sure it is enabled.

If you are using a partner integration, when specifying `products` during the [`/link/token/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate) call, make sure you are not initializing the Item with any Plaid products other than the ones the partner has indicated that it supports.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-11)

- You are using a Link flow that is enabled for [Data Transparency Messaging](https://plaid.com/docs/link/data-transparency-messaging-migration-guide/) and are trying to access an endpoint you did not collect consent for.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-11)

If your Link flow is enabled for [Data Transparency Messaging](https://plaid.com/docs/link/data-transparency-messaging-migration-guide/), check that the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, `optional_products`, or `additional_consented_products` parameters passed to [`/link/token/create`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate) include the product you are requesting.
You can fix any Items with missing consent by using [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/#data-transparency-messaging).

- Public tokens are in the format: `public-<environment>-<identifier>`
- This error can happen when the `public_token` you provided is invalid, pertains to a different API environment, or has expired.

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-12)

Make sure you are not using a token created in one environment in a different environment (for example, using a Sandbox token in the Production environment).

Ensure that the `client_id`, `secret`, and `public_token` are all associated with the same Plaid developer account.

The `public_token` expires after 30 minutes. If your `public_token` has expired, send your user to the Link flow to generate a new `public_token`.

##### The `key_id` provided to the webhook verification endpoint was invalid.

[**Common causes**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#common-causes-15)

- A request was made to [`/webhook_verification_key/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-verification/#get-webhook-verification-key) using an invalid `key_id`.
- The call to [`/webhook_verification_key/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-verification/#get-webhook-verification-key) was made from an environment different than the one the webhook was sent from (for example, verification of a Sandbox webhook was attempted against Production).

[**Troubleshooting steps**](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#troubleshooting-steps-15)

Ensure that the `key_id` argument provided to [`/webhook_verification_key/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-verification/#get-webhook-verification-key) is in fact the `kid` extracted from the JWT headers. See [webhook verification](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-verification/) for detailed instructions.

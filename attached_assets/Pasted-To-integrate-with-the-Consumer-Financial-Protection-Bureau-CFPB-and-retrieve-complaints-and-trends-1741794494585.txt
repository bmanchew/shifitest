This API allows you to programmatically access and analyze consumer complaint data.

**API Documentation:**

**Accessing the API:**

The API is publicly accessible and does not require authentication. You can send HTTP GET requests to the API endpoints to retrieve data. For example, to search for consumer complaints, you can use the following endpoint:

```

**Filtering for Unsecured Personal Loans and Merchant Cash Advances:**

To filter complaints related to unsecured personal loans and merchant cash advances, you can use the `product` parameter in your API request. The CFPB categorizes these under "Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan." For example:


```
GET https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/api/v1/?product=Payday%20loan,%20title%20loan,%20or%20personal%20loan
```


**Filtering by Date Range:**

To retrieve complaints from the past 12 months, you can use the `date_received_min` and `date_received_max` parameters. For instance, to get complaints received between March 12, 2024, and March 12, 2025:


```
GET https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/api/v1/?product=Payday%20loan,%20title%20loan,%20or%20personal%20loan&date_received_min=2024-03-12&date_received_max=2025-03-12
```

**Analyzing Trends:**

To analyze trends over time, you can aggregate complaint data by month or quarter. The API returns data in JSON format, which you can parse and analyze using your preferred programming language or data analysis tools.
